The datebox extension is simple to use.

Include both the .js and the .css, then for field you
wish to activte it for, set type="datebox" or date-type="datebox".

To-Do: 

  learn the standard ui classes to put the style names more inline
  with other extensions.

  learn the mobile plugin framework, make this conform to it.

  figure out how the behavior of the base jquerymobile select plugin works - 
  specifically, the 'no new window' behavior on wider screens.
