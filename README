The datebox extension is simple to use.

Include both the .js and the .css, then for field you
wish to activte it for, set type="datebox" or date-type="datebox".

Then call the method on each. i.e. $('#date').datebox();

To-Do: 

  auto-attach to 'date' form elements? maybe those with data-type="datebox" only?

  still not using the same method that the select plugin does.  Fades rather
  than uses a page transition.  That would be nicer.

  need to alter the display classes to look a little nicer on android (conform
  to screen size better)
