DateBox is a small, android-esk date picker, using as many of the native 
jQueryMobile controls as possible.

This is based in part on the work of Todd M. Horst, and his Android Like Date Picker 2

DateBox Features:

 * Auto-parses text entered into form element on open [any valid date string in
	 your browsers locale, uses javascript:Date()]

 * Input items on DateBox are directly editable, allowing for quick date change.

 * Auto-corrects out of bounds (calendar invalid) dates into the closest real 
	date [e.g. Feb 31st becomes March 2nd or 3rd depending on the year]

 * Attempts to position itself centered over the input, however, the top will 
	never be less than 45px from the top boundry of the document.

 * Click outside to close, configurable with option 'clickOutsideClose'

 * Press ESC to close, configurable with option 'closeEscape' 
 
 * .datebox('enable') and .datebox('disable') now fully functional.

To-Do:

 * Create it's own class for the input - currently it is bastardizing the search class.

 * Figure out how to hook into base jQueryMobile plugins to avoid needing any
	 per-page jQuery to fire DateBox.

Suggested Use:

		// BEFORE loading jQM
		$( document ).bind( "mobileinit", function(){
			$.mobile.page.prototype.options.degradeInputs.date = 'text';
		});
		
		// AFTER loading jQM and jQM-DateBox
		$(document).ready(function() {
			$('input[data-role="datebox"]').datebox();
		});
		
		<input type="date" data-role="datebox" name="some_date" />
